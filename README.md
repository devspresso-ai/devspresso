# Devspresso
Devspresso is an open-source coding tool designed to let developers delegate coding to an LLM via text prompting, similar to how one would do code reviews or pair programming.

## Uses
The tool is particularly good at well-defined, repetitive coding tasks. Examples include:
- Writing tests for single functions/methods.
- Converting literal data formats from one form into another.
- Automating trivial code refactor tasks like renaming or indentation.
- Improving the style of code.
- Commenting code.

In addition, the code is well-versed at implementing algorithms, and can effectively implement the types of math-heavy or corner-case-heavy functions that humans tend to be less effective at.

## Roadmap
Several core improvements on the roadmap:
- Code diff view for the current file vs. generated output
- Ability to save current file and/or generated output to disk
- Ability to select underlying code gen model
- Shortcut list for common coding tasks
